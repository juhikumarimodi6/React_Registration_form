# React Basic Registration Form

This is a simple React application that provides a basic registration form with fields for First Name, Last Name, Email, and a Register button. The form validates whether all the fields are filled out before allowing registration. If any of the fields are left empty, it will display an error message indicating that the particular field is required. On successful registration, a message will be shown, thanking the user for registering.
